# About Me

Exploring the World of Data.
My journey into the data industry wasnâ€™t a straight path; it was shaped by curiosity, problem-solving, and a drive to understand how things work. I started in IT administration and technical consulting, managing systems, networks, and cloud services. But over time, I realized that what fascinated me most wasnâ€™t just keeping things running; it was the data behind it all.

That curiosity led me into business intelligence, where I built dashboards, optimized data pipelines, and helped stakeholders turn raw numbers into meaningful insights. But I didnâ€™t stop there. I wanted to go deeper, to understand not just how to present data, but how to analyze it, model it, and make predictions. Thatâ€™s why I pursued data science, expanding my skills in machine learning, analytics, and automation.

Today, I see myself as more than just a BI Developer; Iâ€™m someone who thrives on solving problems with data. Whether it's building ETL processes, designing dashboards, or exploring machine learning models, I love finding ways to turn complex data into something useful.

This space is where I share my projects, ideas, and experiments as I continue growing in this ever-evolving world of data and analytics.
